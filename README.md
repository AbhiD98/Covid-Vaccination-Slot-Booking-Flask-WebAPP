# Covid-Vaccination-Slot-Booking-Flask-WebAPP
This Flask app manages COVID vaccination centers and user bookings. Users can log in, sign up, book vaccination slots within center hours, and view bookings. Admins can add, edit, and delete centers. SQLAlchemy handles data storage in SQLite with Flask-Login for authentication.
